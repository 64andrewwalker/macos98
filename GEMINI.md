# Gemini AI Agent Guidelines

## Development Methodology

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: This project strictly follows test-driven development practices. When working on new features or bug fixes:

1. **Write tests first** — Define the expected behavior through test cases before writing any implementation code.
2. **Implement code** — Write the minimum code necessary to make the tests pass.
3. **Refactor** — Improve code quality while keeping tests green.

This approach ensures code is reliable, maintainable, and behavior is clearly defined from the start.
